# Tweeter Project

Tweeter is a simple, single-page Twitter clone. Completed in three days.

This project was excellent practice with JQuery, AJAX, CSS/SASS, and JS on the front end, as well as Express, and MongoDB on the back end! The focus of this project was implementing a functional single page application. Front end was certainly the focus, and I would add registration/login functionality next.

## Character count is functional and turns red when too many characters are used! Tweets update automatically through JQuery.
